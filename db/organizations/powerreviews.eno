description: "Unify and Amplify the Voice of the Consumer
| The PowerReviews mission is to unify and amplify the voice of the consumer throughout their journey, across all channels to help consumers make better purchase decisions and to help businesses drive sales and improve products and services.  
| Unify
| Unifying the voice of the consumer in an integrated platform and database, PowerReviews delivers a streamlined, mobile-friendly experience for consumers as they provide feedback throughout their shopping journey and a product’s lifecycle.
| Consumers can read and provide feedback on products, sellers, services, locations and experiences before, during, and after their purchase. And businesses can mine that feedback for insights to improve their offerings, while optimizing and personalizing the consumer journey, online and in-store.
| Amplify
| PowerReviews amplifies the voice of the consumer by distributing content to its Open Syndication Network of more than 2,500 retailers on more than 5,000 websites. Consumer ratings also appear in Google Search results, Product Listing Ads, and Seller Ratings and are leveraged in media, social, and digital marketing campaigns. Advanced fraud detection and moderation ensure the authenticity of consumer feedback, extending not only the reach, but also the power of reviews."
