description: "OpenShareCount aims to make this process a little simpler by providing a drop-in replacement for the old, undocumented and unofficial API endpoint that all the existing official and non-official share buttons were using. For people using X's default button, OpenShareCount provides a bubble with a counter to place next to it."
