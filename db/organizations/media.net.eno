description: "Media.net has one of the most comprehensive portfolios of advertising technology in the industry across search, display, mobile, native, local, products and video. Its platform & products are licensed by various publishers, ad networks, and other ad tech companies worldwide. Each product implementation has the feature set required to execute successfully. Media.net builds products that auto-learn and optimize to display the most relevant ads and offers to end-users in formats that provide a balance of user experience and revenue, and provide industry leading user privacy protections. This creates long-term sustainable value and, at the same time, maximizes publisher revenue and provides high ROI to advertisers. It simplifies online advertising by building top-tier products across multiple segments within ad tech such that all of the customers’ needs are met without them having to engage multiple vendors, or at their option, to use the Company’s platform to unify the solutions from multiple vendors that they want to manage. Media.net’s offerings incorporate proprietary machine learning algorithms, sophisticated data processing, and detailed analytics capabilities to successfully target internet users. It currently manages traffic that generates 70+ million paid ad clicks each month (as at Q1 2016). To put this into perspective, at the industry average display CTR of 0.08%, it wouldrequire others an estimated 87.5+ billion display ad impressions permonth to generate this volume of ad clicks.
| Media.net’s suite is constantly self-optimizing based on its ability to analyze and learn from vast volumes of data. Additional data obtained from the volume of transactions on the platform make its algorithms more intelligent, leading to higher quality matching, stronger ROI for advertisers, and increased revenue for publishers. As a result of this high quality matching, Media.net attracts even more sellers, which in turn attracts more buyers, leading to strong network effects. Further, Media.net is the original creator of the display-to-search (D2S) ad format, a highly sophisticated method of monetizing display placements by identifying user search intent and displaying relevant search keywords which lead to display of search ads bought by advertisers on a cost per click (CPC) pricing model. Advertisers have seen extremely high conversion/sales through this format without the risk of having to buy cost per thousand impressions (CPM) based media where they run the risk of paying for media with which users did not engage. Hence, this format enjoys uncapped advertising budgets as it is seen by advertisers as a cost of sales rather than an operating expense from a discretionary marketing budget. Media.net’s robust technology platform, extensive product features, rigorous quality and compliance standards, and experience in quickly ramping to achieve scale represent meaningful and lasting competitive advantages that have generated powerful results for Media.net’s publisher and advertiser clients."
